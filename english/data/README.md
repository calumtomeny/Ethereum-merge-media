# Live Data

The following links provide up to the minute data for everything going on with the merge and are used by the general public to see the health of the overall system. 


1) [Beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/) - See details about the Beacon Chain (consensus layer). The Beacon chain consists of validators who propose blocks and vote on whether blocks were proposed correctly.
This site allows you to see details about specific validators (like deposit address and rate of return), statistics of all validators (like total number and active balance)
and information about slashings (validators punished for malicious activity)

2) [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) - One of the most popular block explorers, which allows you to see which transactions have been included in each block. 

3) [Dune Analytics Dashboard by @hildobby](https://dune.com/hildobby/ETH2-Deposits) - A live-updating dashboard of graphs and statistics relating to Ethereum staking activity. Includes things like:
    - Amount deposited over time
    - Breakdown of known depositors (e.g. exchanges, pools, service providers)

4) [Beaconscan](https://beaconscan.com/) - See details about the Beacon Chain. An alternative for Beaconcha.in, made by Etherscan.

Note: While the above sites are generally considered accurate, any of the tools could have bugs and running your own node is the only way to guarantee data.
